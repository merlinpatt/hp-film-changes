## Serpensortia!

Plotlines that were twisted in the transition to the screen:

- Crouch junior is not only already free but present in the opening scene at the Riddle House. He is instructed to gather their "old comrades" by sending them a sign, rather than casting Morsmordre because of his own angry impulse to terrify them. Harry subsequently recognizes him after the Pensieve visions although in the book he had never seen him as himself before, in vision or reality.
- Harry's first nightmare about events at the Riddle House takes place at the Burrow, since the initial Privet Drive scenes were omitted. He wakes up with Hermione standing over him, the order of their arrival having been reversed. In the book, Hermione arrived at the Burrow the afternoon before Harry did, but in the film she says that she arrived in the night (apparently after the boys went to bed, sinec Harry didn't know she'd arrived).
- Arthur Weasley, when asked where they're going when en route to the World Cup, says that he doesnt have the foggiest idea, rather than explaining how hard the Ministry had to work to make the arrangements.
- The entire explanation of Portkeys is compressed to the introduction of the term by the twins (rather than Arthur with an accompanying explanation as in the book), and Harry as result nearly fails to grab hold when the time comes.
- The way the first Portkcy works in the film doesnit tally with its description in the book
  - Those using the Portkey are shown talking to one another (though briefly) in transit
  - The older members of the party are shown flying through the air upon their arrival at the Portkey terninus rather than simply arriving.
- Upon their arrival at the World Cup campground, there are several people flying openly
on broomsticks (to name one instance of open magic), rather than Ministry officials
fussing over signs of magic as children barely hovering above the grass on toy
broomsticks.
- The Weasleys' tent (a single one rather than a pair as in the book) has already been set up before their arrival, rather than the party having to set it up themselves.
- The Weasleys are not in the top box with Fudge and the Malfoys in the film.
- Ginny rather than Hermione or Harry asks who Krum is when he takes the field at the World Cup.
- The players rather than the mascots perform the pre-match entertainment at the World Cup. The Irish side displays a glittering, animated leprechaun image in the sky rather than glittering shamrock formed by leprechauns as in the book.
- Fudge rather than Bagman gives the speech at the World Cup.
- Since Bill. Charlie, and Percy are not the World Cup, Arthur doesnt suggest that the older members of the family help the Ministry against the Death Eaters, but instead tries to get them all to a Portkey to get out right away.
- Harry is separated from the entire party and knocked out during the post-match riot; his wand is never stolen.
- Molly giving the boys their new dress robes. Instead, Ron receives his by post (apparently not even owl post).
- The Prophet article about the riot is introduced by a copy being read by Hermione on the Hogwarts Express rather than by Molly on the morning after the match.
- Cho is first encountered in the story on the Hogwarts Express rather than on the World Cup campgrounds.
- Harry writes the first letter to Sirius only after the riot and prodding by Hermione, rather than immediately after the pre-match dream and on his own initiative. Consequently Hedwig is with him on the Hogwarts Express rather than off delivering his letter.
- The Hognuts students watch the arrival of their guests from the windows of the Great Hall on the first day of term rather than from out on the grounds just before Halloween as in the book.
- The students from Beauxbatons are introduced as "ladies", implying that there are no boys among them, although al least two Beauxbatons boys werc present in GF23.
- The dancing and other seductive behaviours of the Veela from the World Cup from the book are transposed to the Beauxbatons students upon their arrival at Hogwarts.
- Hagrid becoming so distracted by Madame Maxime when she first speaks to him at the high table that he stabs Professor Flitwick in the hand with fork. (In the book, Madame Maxime spoke of the care and handling of the winged horses to
Dumbledore when Hagrid was not present.)

- To demonstrate his ability to see ouL of the back ofhis head during his first class, the fake
Moody chastises Seamus Finnigan fot sticking chewing gun under his desk rather than
Lavender holding her horoscope under her 10 show to Parvati Palil,
- 'lhe fake Moody's apparent amusement at thc behaviour of the spider under the Imperius
Curse in the hook, he took the demonstration seriously throughout. (Also, in the book
the spider remained his desk ragher than being bounced off the students only the last
spider in the book looked like it might roll off the desk and hit a smdent)'
- the film, Hermione refuses to name the last tJnforgivable Curse rather than stating tbc
incantation as in the vuso, in the book she and the boys sought out Neville 10 see if
was all right rather than running into him as in tbc film,
- Weasley t'"ins getting into a fist fight uhen their trick lüils to work, and the absence
of their friend Lee Jordan from their planning.
- speech after the selection of the firsl three champions emphasizes the
competition rather than the unifring aspects the situation.
- Dumbledore's rude remarks to Madame Maxime in response to her protest about Harrys
selection, and his subsequgnl accusatory and th:eatening behaviour toward Harry.
- Crouch senior's statement that the Goblet of Fire itself constitutes a binding magical
contract. (In fact, thep/uejng ofa name within it is vo'hat constituncs thc binding magical
contract* not the artilåct itsclf„)
- Sirius sends his first reply 10 Harry nol via Hedwig but by another owl. (The reluctance to
use Iledwig becausc of her distinctive appearance is canon. though.)
- 'Ilme depiction of fire talking as a faec formed front the eoals of the rather than a
disembodied normal-looking head being visible in the
- POTTER STINKS badges appear in the film after the dragons' first appearance
rather than before.
- Rather thau finding out about the dragons only during the first task, he finds out
before Ilarry does and nevenheless refuses to reconcile with I Iarry umlil after the first
task, which gives their falling out. a much nastier aspect than in canon, (Also, in the book
llarry found out about the dragons befo»e speaking with Sirius, aftenva.rd).
- Ilarcy openly walks up to Cedric and asks for word rather than arranging to speak to
him more privately,
- ferret incident happens outdoors after the revelation of the dragons rather than in the
Entrance Hall before the fourth years' first Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson Of the
Also. the incident blows up not of the Prophej's covcragc of the Arthurs
covcrup of Moody's involvement with the police and Harry's counterattack about Draco's
mother, but more from general stress.
- The reference about knowing stories about a Death Eater that •would makc someone's hair
curl is transferred from Rita Skeeter speak"ng to HRII to the fake Moody yelling at Draeo
(who runs away rather than being hauled before Snape).
- Hermione sneaking up to the champions' tent just before the first task for an eneotuaging
word and a hug. rather than drilling Harry in the Summoning Charm all night beforehand.
This leads to developing Krum a little more, when he tells off Skeeter after her
subsequent photograph-taking ambush,
- waiting until after 'he's attacked by Horntail to Surnmon his broom

- I'he breaking of the Horntail's chain and her pursuit of Viaryr This tics in 'åith the
elimination or the teal eggs from the in the book she not as nesting mother
would have them unprotected.
- McGonagall neglecting to tell Vlany Ihal champions open the dancing, and that he has
no choice bug 10 ask someone out.
- Berrnione's quarrel with Ron after the dancing doesn't end with her leaving the seetu: on a
high note, but with him leaving,
- The fake Moody than the Weasley twins collects Ron and Henniorae before the

- Cauch seniot's. appearance at the second task. his talk ahout having no family, and his
meeting with the fake Moody.
- Crouch senior is simply found dead in the forest rather than disappearing, and the
discovery of the hody is presented differently. Somc of content of Fudge's
disagreement with Dumbledore is moved to their tneeting at this point in the Story.
- Harry has no trouble getting into Dumbledore's office. although there is still a mention of
- All the trials in the Pensicve are compressed into a single trial. Karkaroff gives up Crouch
junior's name along with the others; no Dementors appear to be guarding him.
- Snape and Karkm•off meeting privately rather than Potions.
- Snape's reference to Voldemort as rather than "'the Dark Lord" (which
is the form he nonnally uses in referring to the man).
- It's openly revealed bctorc the third task that the fake Moody placed the eup in the maze,
urid its location. is not necessarily the center ofthe as in the book, Also, it's said that
first to touch the Clip will be '"the winner" rather then merely •treeciving full
paints".
- Harw actually finds Fleur in the rather than just hearing her. Hc also recognizes

who-saved-who stakes are a bit less balanced between them in the film than in the book.
- Harry and CédriC have much in the graveyard in

said it.
- the book, ordinary eoniured ropcs were to bind blatty rather than an
statue, (Looks cool, though.)
- Pettigrew's incantation in the film dillVrs somewhat from thal in canon, he cuts Harry
more than and doesn't seem as badly affect,ed physiealiy by his 0',vTt sacrifice as in
the book.
The subsequent pyrotechnics were an added flourish for Lhe film Note that Voldemort in
the film does not have to ask for robes after his rebirth; they appear by themselves.
- Voldemort using the expressions "attaboy"' and "yedh" rather than keeping to mote
- Harry breaks down after returning with Cedric's body rather than being unable to cry, and is not hustled away before Amos Diggory arrives and breaks down.
- The fake Moody's Polyjuice Potion begins to wear off while he's still talking to Harry; he is never knocked unconscious, nor is he given the Dementor's Kiss due to Fudge's interference.  The real Moody is also conscious when he is found in the trunk (and nobody hops in to make him more comfortable until he can be transferred to the hospital wing).


## Switching Spells

- See Film 1 Switching Spells regarding the cast.
- Crouch junior in lhe film has dark rather than straw-coloured hair.
- Owls are shown carrying letters in their beaks rather than having them bound to a leg as
in the books. (That'd be much harder on an owl during a long journey...)
- The winged horses pulling the Beauxbatons carriage don't appear to have palomino colouring (which would be gold body colouring with white manes and tails), but instead the inverse of that colouring. They don't seem to be the size of elephants as in canon, but it's very hard to tell since they aren't shown close to anything that would put them in a reliable perspectiver. Judging from the scene in which they arrive at Hogwarts, there are nine (three on the left, three on the right, two in the middle front and back) rather than twelve.
- The Beauxbatons carriage on close examination appears to be powder-blue (which agrees with canon), although the red and gold trim makes it diffcult to see this when the carriage is motion.
- Madame Maxime in the film has red rather than black hair, doesn't arrive wearing elegant black satin, and is noticeably taller than Hagrid rather than being within an inch or so of his height.
- Dumbledore's beard appears more grey than white. This effect may be partly due to the
fact that he wears grey robes rather than deep green robes at the Welcoming Feast and at
the seiection of champions. See also Conjuring Spells.
- The singing of the Hogwarts school song (which was omitted from the first film) was filmed, though deleted, for this film. It's much more polished on film than the singing of it was depicted in PS7. (In the finished film, it's sung impromptu just before the discovery of Crouch senior's body.)
- The size of the Goblet of Fire and the manner of its presentation. In the book, Dumbledore simply reached into the casket and pulled it out, and the flames were the only unusual aspect of its appearance.
- The Owlery is shown as part of a tower detached from the main building of the castle rather than in West Tower.
- Magical Water Plants of the Mediterranean is switched for Magical Water Plants of the Highland Lochs (which so far doesn't exist in canon). This is part writing out the house-elves' role, which involved giving Neville the role of informing Harry about the properties of Gillyweed.
- Seamus Finnigan rather than Neville is depicted as being accident-prone, though with a different flavour (he says he thinks fire is pretty fascinating, rather than being depressed by his difficulties).
- The golden egg is small enough to be held easily in one hand, and doesn't appear empty when open and singing.
- Placing Padma Patil in Gryffindor with her sister (she's in Gryffindor common room with her sister rather than her sister being with Lavender Brown when Harry thinks of asking them), and the fact that both sisters wear pink to the Yule Ball instead of one wearing pink and the other turquoise.
- Hermione wears pink to the Yule Bull rather than blue as in the book. (The pink was worn by Pansy Parkinson, Draco Malfoy's date, in the book.)
- Cedric's clue isn't given immediately after the Yule Ball; he waits until two days before the second task.
- Harry's dream (GF29) takes place at night after the Yule Ball rather than in Divination shortly before the third task, and is more confused memory of the first dream than a vision.
- mermaid in the prefects' bathroom is part ofa stained glass •vvindow rather than a
portrait, and she's awake during Harry's visit.
