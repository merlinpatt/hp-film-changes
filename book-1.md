# Deletrius!

Major characters and events from the book not included in the movie:

- Vernon Dursley's Day, as the wizarding world is more apparent in their celebration of the disappearance of Voldemort.
- Mention of Mrs. Figg.
- Piers Polkiss's additional attendance to the zoo and appearance as a character at all.
- Parts of Uncle Dursley's madness.  Major snippets of his attempts to avoid the letters have been left out, including a jaunt to an inn and to the middle of a forest.
- Harry and Draco's first meeting, in Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions.
- The details of James' and Lily's wands.  Somewhat minor but nice facts about their size and composition.
- Peeves the Poltergeist!  (Reportedly was filmed, and a voice actor hired, but was cut for time.)
- The Sorting Hat's song.  Draco's challenge of a duel and Ron and Harry's attempt to meet up with him at night.
- The "secret" arrival of Harry's Nimbus 2000.  McGonagall covers up the broomstick that is delivered to Harry in the book, to keep his Quidditch playing a secret until the first game, but it is quite obvious and dramatically done in the movie.
- The rest of Harry's family, aside from his mother and father, in the Mirror of Erised.
- Nicholas Flamel.  Mentioned in a scene that later appeared on the DVD, he is hardly mentioned in the theatrical version, and his Chocolate Frogs card doesn't get its proper place, even in the cut scene.
- The centaurs Bane and Ronan.
- "Hermione's Task:" the potion riddle Hermione solves to get Harry to the stone was cut, perhaps because it is not nearly as cinematic as Ron's chess task.

# Serpensortia!

Plotlines that were twisted in the transition to the screen:

- Norbert's removal, and the susbsequent detentions into the Forbidden Forest.  Though Harry and Hermione go to great lengths in the book to get Norbert sent off with Charlie Weasley, Dumbledore simplifies matters in the movie and sends him himself. 
- The fourth person to get detention with Draco, Harry, and Hermione changes from Neville in the book to Ron in the movie, to suit this alteration.
- McGonagall makes an Animagus transformation for her class in the first movie, but in the books, the students first see it in their third year.

# Switching Spells

- The snake is from Brazil in the book, but bred in captivity but native to Burma in the movie.
- Dudley and Aunt Petunia are described in the books as blonde, but are dark-haired in the movie.
- Harry's parents look quite a bit older than they should. They were about 22 when they died, but in the film they look like they're in their mid-thirties at least.

# Conjuring spells 

Additions to the movie without direct canon backing:

- The full-out depiction of Voldemort's attack on Harry and Lily Potter is only in the book in Hagrid's dialogue, but becomes a first-hand depiction of the flashback in the film.
- The plaque which proclaims James Potter as a Quidditch seeker.
- Though there is no real desciption of the Hogwarts uniforms or obvious differentiation in house appearances in the books, the films have added house crests, ties, and prep-school-inspired clothing under the cloaks.
