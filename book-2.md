## Deletrius!

Major characters and events from the book not included in the movie:

- The Ministry letter to warn Harry about the underage use of magic.
- The Burrow's garden gnomes
- Harry seeing Draco and Lucius Malfoy at Knockturn Alley only appears in the deleted scenes, but not in the main version of the movie.
- Arthur and Lucius's fight at Flourish and Blotts.
- Peeves the Poltergeist -- Still no movie appearance.
- Mention of Ron's detention and the fact that he recognized Tom Riddle name from an award he received for special services to the school.
- The Deathday Party of Sir Nicholas de Mimsey Porpingtonl, also known as Nearly Headless Nick.
- The scenes in which Lockhart lectures Harry for giving out autographs (due to Colin's actual request in the book) and makes him late for Herbology.
- The need for Hermione to get permission from Lockhart to get into the restricted section; in the movie, Hermione finds Moste Potente Potions on the regular shelves.
- Harry, Ron, and Hermione's diversion and rule-breaking in Potions class in order to get ingredients for the Polyjuice.
- The Polyjuice Potion's effects on Harry's vision and on both Harry and Ron's voices are removed in the movie, and they have to fake Crabbe and Goyle's voices.
- The Valentine's Day shenanigans, including Lockhart's cherubs and Ginny's infamous Singing Valentine for Harry
- Percy's mysterious behavior and the character of Penelope Clearwater.
- Almost all foreshadowing hints about Ginny acting strangely or emotionally.

## Switching Spells

- Arthur Weasley asks Harry about escalators in the book, but rubber ducks in the movie.
- Hermione gets Dumbledore's line, "Fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself," in the movie.
- Hermione also gets the bulk of Ron's lines in Hagrid's hut, describing the significance of the word "Mudblood."
- Again, Hermione gets a line of Ron's when she says that "even in the wizarding world," hearing voices isn't good.
- McGonagall tells the students about the Chamber in the movie, instead of Professor Binns, who has yet to make a real appearance in the movies.
- In the book, after Fawkes injures the basilisk's eyes, Tom Riddle tells the serpent he can still "smell him." In the movie, Tom instructs the serpent that he can still "hear him," resulting in the invention of a scene in the movie involving Harry throwing a rock to mislead the basilisk.
